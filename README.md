### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karthik Velayutham, a software engineer at [Ponder](www.ponder.io) working on the future of scalable data science! Specifically, I've been working on [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin), a drop-in replacement for pandas that scales automatically using any backend of your choice. Previously, I was an engineer at [Katana Graph](www.katanagraph.com), a company focused on building a graph intelligence platform (analytics, AI, querying, mining) for enterprise customers. 

In general I love to play around with technology, so please feel free to comment on any of my work and reach out to me at: karthik.velayutham at gmail.com!
